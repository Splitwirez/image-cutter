ImageCutter is a simple tool for automatically cutting a single image into nine pieces which can be used as a nine-grid, without the need for runtime image slicing.

### Current status

ImageCutter is currently functional enough that you could probably use it, though it still has a few issues which need to be worked out. I wouldn't call it 'production-ready' per se yet, that's for sure.
